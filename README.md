## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project leverages Power BI to perform an in-depth analysis of music streaming data. Through interactive dashboards and DAX-driven metrics, it uncovers trends in user behavior such as:

- When users listen to music most
- Which artists and tracks keep users engaged
- How skip rates vary across platforms and playback types
- What decades and genres dominate listening preferences

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze user engagement and retention based on play duration and skip behavior  
- Identify top-performing artists, albums, and tracks  
- Understand the influence of platform and playback method (manual vs autoplay)  
- Visualize listening trends by day, time, and device  
- Draw insights to improve music recommendation strategies
